# Data_Structure-Problems
Problem 1:
In this problem, you must use your queue. Reimplement part of the stack data
structure using only one queue as an underlying data structure. Reimplement the
class for ‘int’ data type only and with the following functions only:
int top() – returns the top element. 
void pop() – removes the top element.
void push(int value) – adds an element to the top of the stack
//////////
Problem 2:
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e.,
symmetric around its center).
/////////
Problem 3:
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the
same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the
nodes have the same value.
